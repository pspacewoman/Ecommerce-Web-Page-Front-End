# E-commerce Landing Page Project
# Case Study

## Overview
In this project, I demonstrate my front-end development skills by creating an e-commerce landing page for the "Meta Quest 3 VR Headset" on the AMAZON website. The project will showcase - HTML and CSS.

It will be designed to be simple, clean, and focused on the product, with clear specifications and a call-to-action button.

## Features
- Product Showcase: Display of product details, including high-quality images and specifications.

- Call-to-Action (CTA): An action button that encourages users to take action, such as making a purchase or adding to a cart.
- Clear Specifications: Detailed product specifications to help customers in their decision-making process.
  
## Technologies Used
