# E-commerce Landing Page Project

## Overview
In this project, I demonstrate my front-end development skills by creating an e-commerce landing page for the "Meta Quest 3 VR Headset" on the AMAZON website. The project will showcase the use of HTML and CSS. 

#Focus
It will be designed to be simple, clean, and focused on the product, with clear specifications and a call-to-action button.

## Features
- Product Showcase: Display of product details, including high-quality images and specifications.
- Responsive Design: In future, I will try to make it work for cross-platform, maybe mobile view.
- Call-to-Action (CTA): An action button that encourages users to take action, such as making a purchase or adding to a cart.
- Clear Specifications: Detailed product specifications to help customers in their decision-making process.
  
## Technologies Used
- HTML: The structure of the page.
- CSS: To create a visually appealing layout.
- JavaScript: Future work. For any interactive features (like a shopping cart or dynamic elements).

## Why Do Landing Pages Exist?
- They are essential in marketing and web design because they serve a specific purpose like -
- Unlike homepages that serve many purposes, landing pages focus on one specific action, such as purchasing a product, checking details of the item, comparing and others.
- They are used to introduce new products and provide detailed information. By having all relevant information in one place, the decision-making process for customers becomes easy while shopping.

## How Do Landing Pages Exist?
Landing pages exist as standalone web pages, separate from the main website and from what I have observed, they are often used at the intersection with marketing campaigns. Here's how they exist:
- they can exist as sub-web pages on the main website
- they can exist independently like the one I am creating, "GitHub Landing Pages"
