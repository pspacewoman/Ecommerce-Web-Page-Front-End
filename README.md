# E-commerce Landing Page Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates my front-end development skills by creating an e-commerce landing page for the "Meta Quest 3 VR Headset". The project will showcase HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript capabilities. It is designed to be simple, clean, and focused on product presentation with clear specifications and a call-to-action button for user interaction.

## Features
- **Product Showcase**: Display of product details, including high-quality images and specifications.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: A prominent button that encourages users to take action, such as making a purchase.
- **Clear Specifications**: Detailed product specifications to aid customers in their decision-making process.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: The structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Styling to create a visually appealing layout.
- **JavaScript**: For any interactive features (like a shopping cart or dynamic elements).

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main structure of the landing page.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet for the pageâ€™s design.
- `script.js`: For any JavaScript functionality (future enhancements can go here).
- `images/`: Folder containing product images.
